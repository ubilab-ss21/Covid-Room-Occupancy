# Covid-Room-Occupancy
The goal of this project is to keep a check on the maximum number of people in a single room.
We will first detect the human presence on the main entrance  via IR-break beam/Ultrasonic sensor in the doorway.
The idea will be to have two such sensors kept apart to distinguish whether a person has entered a room or left the room.

To increase the precision we will also try to keep a check by measuring the CO2-level.
Further as needed we may also use a  Pressure sensor on the mat , PIR sensor,
maybe and break-beam, or other sensors.A advanced version of a PIR sensor if used will be able to also detect the temperature
of humans and hence to detect the presence of humans even in stationary  situations. Also this can be used to set an alarm or something similar when a human with increased body temperature is detected in the room.


Timeline:
May end : Procurement of hardware and finalization of small details and initial work.
June end : Partial software realization.
July Mid: Initial draft of the prototype.
July end : Actual implementation of the functionality.

Test :
Basic test would be to approximately detect the number of people in a room and raise an alarm or
something similar when the number of persons exceed a certain threshold value.
