# Covid-Room-Occupancy o keep a check on the maximum number of people in a single room.
We will first detect the human presence on the main entrance Â via Ultrasonic sensors in the doorway.
The idea will be to have two such sensors kept apart to distinguish whether a person has entered a room or left the room.

To increase the precision we will also try to keep a check by measuring the CO2-level.
Further as needed we may also use a Pressure sensor on the mat or a PIR sensor or any other applicable sensors. We are going to implement a buzzer alarm or something similar to indicate that the number people present in a room have exceeded a certain maximum limit.

COMPONENTS USED:
1.ESP32 Pico D4 Development Board
2.Ultrasonic sensors
3.CO-2, Humidity, Temperature sensors
4.Buzzer
5.Connecting wires and supporting components.

Timeline:

May end : Procurement of hardware and finalization of small details and initial work.
June end : Partial software realization.
July Mid: Initial draft of the prototype.
July end : Actual implementation of the functionality.

Test :
Basic test would be to approximately detect the number of people in a room and raise an alarm or
something similar when the number of persons exceed a certain threshold value.
